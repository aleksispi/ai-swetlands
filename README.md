# AI-Swetlands: A pre-study about using artificial intelligence for semantic segmentation of Swedish wetland types

This repo contains code for training and evaluating wetland segmentation models, that was used in a [pre-study about AI for wetland monitoring in Sweden](https://github.com/aleksispi/ai-swetlands/blob/main/ai-swetlands.pdf) during the fall of 2022. A popular scientific description in Swedish can be hound [here](https://www.naturvardsverket.se/om-oss/aktuellt/nyheter-och-pressmeddelanden/ai-teknik-testas-for-att-identifiera-vatmarker/).

### Data preprocessing
Note: Before starting with this data preprocessing step, ensure you have access to the various tiff-files referenced in `preprocess_wetlands.py`.

### Training a model for wetland segmentation

### Using a pre-trained segmentation model across all of Sweden to perform a full wetland mapping
